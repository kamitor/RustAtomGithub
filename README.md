My next personal objectives will be as follows:

1. Run several cargo excersizes and build basic API's.
2. Let API be exposed to Web
3. Let RUST code run on website or functional application
4. Setup JENKINS or Puppit for contineous development
5. Setup advanced programs (3 dimentional arrays, functions calling functions calling functions)
